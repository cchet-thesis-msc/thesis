\section{Measurements of the prototype}
\label{sec:empiric}
There will be structural and organizational differences between the ESB prototype and an ESB implementation which is not integrated in an cloud environment such as Openshift and does not make use of the microservice architecture and DevOps. These structural differences are expected to arise in the organization of the sources, secrets, build and deploy of an ESB application in Openshift. 

The build, test and deploy times of an ESB application should radically decrease because of the separation of the ESB application into microservices which get build, test and deployed independently. This can be compared to an ESB application which does not make use of the microservice architecture as well.

Therefore that the ESB application will be integrated in the cloud system Openshift, some aspects of the ESB application will be implemented with Openshift mechanisms, where it can be shown how the impact of this integration into Openshift is on the ESB application.
