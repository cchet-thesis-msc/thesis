\section{Prototype}
\label{sec:prototype}
An ESB application will be implemented and integrated in Openshift. The application will not only be hosted in Openshift, the application will also be build and released via Openshift mechanisms.

The actual functionality will not be the focus of the prototype, the focus will be on the integration of the organization of the source, configuration, build and release of the ESB application in the cloud system Openshift. The prototype shall be capable of answer the in section \ref{sec:statement-of-the-problem} raised questions and shall prove that an ESB can be well integrated in the cloud environment Openshift and that not only the application itself can be hosted in an cloud system such as Openshift, but also it's development and release life cycle can be integrated into Openshift.
