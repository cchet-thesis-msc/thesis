\section{Further usage and discussion}
\label{sec:induction}
The evaluation results will be discussed and how they may influence the decisions made by the target audience, who are responsible for the application life cycle of an ESB application. The evaluation results could also have an impact on decision makers on a management level, which can see how an enterprise application such as an ESB application behaves in a cloud system such as Openshift. 

Especially how the ESB application gets integrated in the cloud environment Openshift and how may responsibilities for several aspects of an ESB have moved to Openshift gives a lot room for discussion. The integration in Openshift should provide new possibilities for managing the application and release life cycle of an ESB application.
