\section{Target audience}
\label{sec:target-audience}
The target audience of the thesis will be especially software developers who are working on enterprise software, microservices or software which could be hosted in an cloud environment such as Openshift. Also cloud architects, software product managers and CTOs are part of the target audience because the thesis could help or inspire them to integrate their software applications in a cloud system such as Openshift.

Therefore, that a key factor of DevOps, is the joint work of operations and the software development, the thesis could also be interesting for persons in charge of hosting infrastructure such as service providers like IT\&Tel, because the thesis could help them to understand the developer point of view when an ESB application is hosted in Openshift.

Parts of the thesis could help people to understand the interconnection between containerization (Docker), CaaS (Kubernetes) and PaaS (Openshift) and why there is a need for such technologies these days.
