\section{Target audience}
\label{sec:target-audience}
The target audience of the master thesis will be especially software developers who are working on enterprise software, microservices or software which could be hosted in an cloud environment such as Openshift. Also cloud architects, software product managers and CTO's are part of the target audience because the master thesis could help or inspire them to integrate their software applications in a cloud environment.

Therefore that a key factor of DevOps is the joint work of the infrastructure department and the development department, the master thesis could also be interesting for persons in charge of hosting infrastructure such as service providers like IT\&Tel, because the master thesis could help them to understand the developer point of view when an ESB application is hosted in Openshift.

Parts of the master thesis could help people to understand the interconnection between containerization (Docker), CaaS (Kubernetes) and PaaS and why there is a need for such technologies these days.
