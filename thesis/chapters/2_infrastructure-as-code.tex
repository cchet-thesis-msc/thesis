\chapter{Infrastructure as Code}
\label{cha:iac}
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a concept to automate system creation and change management with techniques from software development. Systems are defined in a Domain Specific Language (DSL), which gets interpreted by a tool, which creates an instance of the system or applies changes to it. IaC defines predefined, repeatable routines for managing systems \cite{Morris2016}. IaC descriptions are called templates, cookbooks, recipes or playbooks, depending on the tool. In the further course, the IaC definitions will be called templates. The DSL allows to define resources of a system such as network, storage and routing descriptively in a template. The DSL abstracts the developer from system specific settings and provides a way to define the system with as little configuration as possible. The term system is used as a general description. In the context of IaC, a system can be anything which can be described via a DSL.

\section{The Need for Infrastructure as Code}
\label{sec:iac-need}
In the so called iron age, the IT systems were bound the physical hardware and the setup of such a system and its change management were a long term, complex and error prone process. These days, we call such systems legacy systems. In the cloud age, the IT systems are decoupled from the physical hardware and in the case of PaaS they are even decoupled from the operating system \cite{Morris2016}. The IT systems are decoupled from the physical hardware and operating system, due to the fact, that cloud providers cannot allow their customer to tamper with the underlying system and hardware. In general, the hardware resources provided by a cloud provider are shared by multiple customers. \\

With IaC it is possible to work with so called Dynamic Infrastructure Platforms, which provide computing resources, where the developers are completely abstracted from the underlying system. Dynamic infrastructure platforms have the characteristic to be programmable, are available on-demand and provide self service mechanisms, therefore we need IaC to work with such infrastructures \cite{Morris2016}. Systems deployed on a dynamic infrastructure platform are flexible, consistent, automated and reproducible. \\

Enterprises which stuck to legacy systems face the problem that technology nimble competitors can work with their infrastructures more efficiently, and therefore can demand lower prices from their customers. This is due to the IaC principles discussed in Section \ref{sec:iac-principles}. Over a short period of time, enterprises will have to move to IaC and away from their legacy systems to stay competitive. The transition process could be challenging for an enterprise, because they lose control over the physical hardware and maybe also over the operating system. Maintaining legacy systems has the effect that someone is close to the system and almost everything is done manually. IaC has the goal to automate almost everything, which requires trust for the cloud providers, who provide the computing resources and the tooling, which provides the automation. A well known problem, which enterprise will face, is the so called Automation Fear Spiral, which is shown in Figure \vref{fig:automation-fear-spiral}.

	\caption{Automation Fear Spiral}
	\label{fig:automation-fear-spiral}
\end{figure} 

Because of no trust for the automation, changes are applied manually to the systems and outside the defined automation process. If the system is reproduced, definitions may be missing in the templates, which leads to an inconsistent system. Therefore, enterprises have to break this spiral to fully profit from IaC \cite{Morris2016}. \\

When enterprises have moved their legacy systems to IaC, they can not only manage their systems faster, they also can profit from the principles of IaC as discussed in Section \ref{sec:iac-principles}. With IaC, systems are less complicated to manage, changes can be applied without fear, and the systems can easily be moved between environments. This provides the enterprises with more space to maneuver, systems can become more complex but still easy to manage, the systems can be defined and created faster which could lower costs.    

\section{Principles of Infrastructure as Code}
\label{sec:iac-principles}
The principles of IaC solve the problems of systems of the iron age. In the iron age the creation and maintenance of systems were a long, complicated and error prone process which consumed a lot of resources and time. With the decoupling of the physical hardware from the system, the creation and maintenance of the system has become simple, due to the IaC DSL and tooling. 

\subsection{Infrastructures are Reproducible}
\label{sec:iac-principles-reproducibility}
With IaC, systems are easy reproducible. It is possible to reproduce the whole infrastructure or parts of it effortlessly. Effortless means, that no tweaks have to be made to the templates or during the reproduction process and there is no need for a long term decision process about what has to be reproduced and how to reproduce it. To be able to reproduce system effortlessly is powerful, because it can be done automatically, consistently and with less risk of failures \cite{Morris2016}. The reproducibility of a system is based on reusable templates which provide the possibility to define parameters, which are set for the different environments as shown in Figure \ref{fig:reproduce-infrastructure}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

	\includegraphics[scale=0.95]{images/reproduce-infrastructure.pdf}
	\caption{Schema of a parametrized infrastructure deployment}
	\label{fig:reproduce-infrastructure}
\end{figure} 

\subsection{Infrastructures are Disposable}
\label{sec:iac-principles-disposable}
Another benefit of IaC is that systems are disposable. Disposable means, that systems can be easily destroyed and recreated. Changes made to the templates of a system does not have to be applied on an existing system, but can be applied by destroying and recreating the system. An requirement for a disposable system is, that it is understood that systems will always change. Other systems relying on a disposable system need to address that the system could change at any time. Systems must not fail because a disposable system disappears and reappears again because of an redeployment \cite{Morris2016}.

\subsection{Infrastructures are Consistent}
\label{sec:iac-principles-consistency}
Systems managed with IaC are consistent, because they are defined via a template and all instances are an instance of the template, with the little configuration differences defined by parameters. As long as the system changes are managed by IaC, the system will stay consistent, and the automation process can be trusted. \\

In Listing \vref{src:iac-template-docker-compose} an example for an IaC template is shown, which defines a Docker Compose service infrastructure for hosting a Wildfly server instance \cite{Wildfly2017, DockerCompose2018}. This system can consistently be reproduced on any environment supporting Docker, Docker Compose and providing values for the defined parameters. \\

\begin{code}
	\yamlFile{\sourceDir/iac-docker-compose.yml}
	\caption{Example for an IaC template for Docker Compose}
	\label{src:iac-template-docker-compose}
\end{code}

\subsection{Actions are Repeatable}
\label{sec:iac-principles-repeatability}
Building reproducible systems, means that any action applied to the system should be repeatable. Without repeatability, the automation cannot be trusted and systems wouldn't be reproducible. An instance of a system in another environment should be equal to any other system instance, except for the configurations defined by parameters. If this is not the case, then a system is not reproducible, because it will have become inconsistent \cite{Morris2016}. \\

IaC is a concept which makes it very easy to deal with systems in the cloud age. Enterprises can make use of IaC to move their legacy systems to the cloud, where they can profit from the principles of IaC. Nevertheless, before an enterprise can profit from IaC, it has to apply clear structures to their development process, as well as sticking to the principles of consistency and repeatability. For experienced administrators, who are used to maintain systems manually, it could sometimes be hard to understand why they are not supposed to perform any actions on the system manually anymore, nevertheless that a manual change could be performed faster. Being capable to reproduce a system at any time with no effort,  or applying changes on an existing system in a predefined and consistent manner,  makes enterprises very flexible and fast. Enterprises will not have to fear future changes in requirements and technologies of their systems anymore.
